# ME134Project2
This repo contains code for ME-134: Robotics Project/Homework 2.
For this assignment we had to create a robot that could write our initials. We chose to use a five-bar base driven design. Trajectory planning and inverse kinematics were performed in Python on a computer while motor control was performed by an ESP32 using C++/Arduino. The results of the inverse kinematics were sent wirelessly to the ESP32 via MQTT protocol.
